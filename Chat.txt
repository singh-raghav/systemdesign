Functional Requirement:

1. Store User data
2. One to One Chat
3. Supporting only text
4. Online presence
5. Last active
6. Sent/Read Acknowledgement
7. Should be able to send messages to Offline user
8. Storing chat history
9. Multiple device support

Good to Have

1. Search chat
2. Send Images/Video/document
3. s




Non Functional:
1. High Avaibility
2. Consistency: a) User should be able to see same chat history in all device
				b) 2nd party should have received the message if it is being marked as received in system.
3. Latency should be low



Estimation:

1.	Considering we have 300 M daily active user
	If each user is sending 5 messages per day
	Total no. of message = 1500 M messages per day
	18000 req per sec (1M request per day ~ 12 req per sec)

2. Considering on an average message size = 500 character
   in One day = 1500M  * 500 character = 75 x 10 ^ 10 character = 75*10^10 bytes = 750 GB 
   in one month = 750 GB *30 = 22.5 TB
   
   


DB Design
	Assuming that we are using SQL.

	Entity:

		1. User
		2. UserStatus
		3. Message
		4. Chat

		
	
	User:
		userId
		name
		contactNumber
		joinedDate
		
	
	UserStatus:
		userId
		lastActive
		isOnline
		isEnabled
		{connectedBox}?
		
		
	Message:
		messageId
		content
		createdTS
		
	Chat:	
		chatId
		senderId
		receiverId
		messageId
		createdTS

1. why Cassandra?
		
	SQL can be used as storage of message , but as data increase , Vertical Scaling , Horizantal Scaling with sharding
    and sharding itself is huge task.

How one to One messaging work:

	
	USER A - > Online 
					 -> Whatsapp LB ->
									 Whatsapp Instance (box1) ChatService , one websoxket connection is established
									   -> ConnectionStorageService
									     -> Store Connection object of USER A to which box it is connected in Distributed Cache (Memcache/Redis/DB)
										 -> get all messages from db which is not received by USER A
	USER B - > Online 
					 -> Whatsapp LB ->
									 Whatsapp Instance (box2) ChatService , one websoxket connection is established
									 -> ConnectionStorageService
									     -> Store Connection object of USER B to which box it is connected in Distributed Cache (Memcache/Redis/DB)
										 -> get all messages from db which is not received by USER B
									 
	USER A -> Send Message to user B
					-> Chat Service will notify user A that chat has been recieved by server
					-> Chat Service will identify whom to send - User B
					-> Chat Service will identify the connection Object of USER B (from ConnectionStorageService) 
					-> Will send message to USER B
					
					-> USER B message received for this messageId
					-> Chat Service will notify USAR A that message has been received by USER B
